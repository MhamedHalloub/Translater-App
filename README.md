# Language Translator App

A simple and user-friendly desktop application for translating text between over 100 languages, developed during my internship at **CodeAlpha**.

## About the Project

This application allows users to input text, select a target language by its full name (e.g., *Arabic*, *French*), and instantly get a translation using the Google Translate API. It features a clean graphical interface built with **Tkinter** and is packaged as a standalone `.exe` for Windows using **PyInstaller**.

## Features

- Translate text between 100+ languages
- Full language names (no confusing language codes)
- Modern, minimal desktop interface
- Built with Python and Tkinter
- Distributed as a standalone Windows executable

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (GUI)
- `googletrans` (Google Translate API wrapper)
- PyInstaller (for `.exe` generation)


## How to Run
